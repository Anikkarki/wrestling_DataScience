A Machine Learning–based application that predicts the most probable winner between two WWE wrestlers using historical match data and wrestler performance features.
Here we have dataset containing wrestlers and matches they have won and lost.
This project analyzes professional wrestling match data to understand wrestler performance, identify top performers for the year 2023, and demonstrate a real-world data science workflow from raw data to insights.
The project follows industry best practices, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and analytical ranking.

This project uses historical WWE match data to:

Train a Logistic Regression model
Predict match outcomes based on wrestler statistics
Provide a user-friendly interface to simulate matches
Display winning probability and feature importance
